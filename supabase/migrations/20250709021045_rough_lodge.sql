/*
# Fix ambiguous column references in queries

1. Changes
   - This migration documents the fix for ambiguous column references in the webhook function
   - The actual fix is in the webhook function code, not in the database schema

2. Details
   - The error "column reference 'subscription_status' is ambiguous" was occurring
   - This happens when multiple tables in a join have columns with the same name
   - The fix is to fully qualify column names in queries (e.g., users.subscription_status)
   - We've updated the webhook code to use proper column references

-- This migration doesn't modify the schema but is included for documentation purposes
SELECT 'Fix applied in webhook function code - using fully qualified column names';
