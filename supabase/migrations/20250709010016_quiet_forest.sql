/*
  # Fix ambiguous column references in webhook handler

  1. Changes
     - This migration doesn't modify the database schema
     - The actual fix is in the webhook function code where we're now using fully qualified column names
     - This migration serves as documentation for the changes made

  2. Background
     - The webhook was encountering errors with ambiguous column references
     - Columns like "subscription_status" exist in multiple tables
     - When joining tables, PostgreSQL couldn't determine which table's column to use
