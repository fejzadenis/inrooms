# Choosing Your Business Structure: A Critical Decision

The legal structure you choose for your business will impact your taxes, personal liability, paperwork, ability to raise money, and more. This decision affects nearly every aspect of your business operations, so it's worth taking the time to make an informed choice.

## Common Business Structures

### Sole Proprietorship
- **Definition**: A business owned and operated by one person with no legal distinction between the owner and the business. This is the default structure when you start a business without filing any paperwork.
- **Best for**: Freelancers, consultants, and low-risk businesses just starting out with minimal startup capital.
- **Pros**: 
  - Simple to form with no filing requirements
  - Complete control over all decisions
  - Minimal paperwork and regulatory requirements
  - Pass-through taxation (business income reported on personal taxes)
  - Lowest cost option to start and maintain
- **Cons**: 
  - Unlimited personal liability for all business debts and legal issues
  - Difficult to raise capital from investors
  - Limited life (ends with owner)
  - May appear less professional to clients and partners
  - Limited tax deduction opportunities

### Limited Liability Company (LLC)
- **Definition**: A hybrid structure that provides the liability protection of a corporation with the tax benefits of a partnership. LLCs have become the most popular entity choice for small businesses.
- **Best for**: Small to medium businesses seeking liability protection without corporate complexity, including service businesses, real estate holdings, and startups not seeking venture capital.
- **Pros**: 
  - Limited personal liability protection
  - Pass-through taxation (no double taxation)
  - Management flexibility (member-managed or manager-managed)
  - Fewer formalities than corporations
  - Flexible profit distribution not tied to ownership percentage
- **Cons**: 
  - More expensive to form than sole proprietorships
  - Self-employment taxes for active members
  - May have franchise taxes in some states
  - Can be harder to raise venture capital
  - Some states have publication requirements

### C Corporation
- **Definition**: A legal entity completely separate from its owners, with its own rights and liabilities. This is the traditional corporate structure used by most large companies.
- **Best for**: Businesses planning to go public, raise significant venture capital, or scale significantly with multiple investors.
- **Pros**: 
  - Limited personal liability protection
  - Ability to issue multiple classes of stock
  - Attractive to venture capital and investors
  - Perpetual existence independent of owners
  - Tax deductible business expenses and benefits
  - No limit on number of shareholders
- **Cons**: 
  - Double taxation (corporate and dividend income)
  - More expensive to form and maintain
  - Extensive recordkeeping requirements
  - More regulatory oversight
  - Less management flexibility
  - Required board meetings and minutes

### S Corporation
- **Definition**: A corporation that elects to pass corporate income, losses, deductions, and credits through to shareholders for federal tax purposes. It's essentially a tax election rather than a distinct entity type.
- **Best for**: Small to medium businesses that would benefit from corporate structure but want pass-through taxation, particularly those with significant profits that could benefit from reduced self-employment taxes.
- **Pros**: 
  - Limited personal liability protection
  - Pass-through taxation (avoids double taxation)
  - Potential tax savings on self-employment taxes
  - Separate legal entity from owners
  - Perpetual existence
- **Cons**: 
  - Strict qualification requirements
  - Limited to 100 shareholders
  - Only one class of stock allowed
  - All shareholders must be U.S. citizens/residents
  - More formalities than an LLC
  - Cannot be owned by other corporations or partnerships

### Partnership
- **Definition**: A business relationship between two or more people who conduct business together. There are several types: General Partnerships, Limited Partnerships (LP), and Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP).
- **Best for**: Professional groups like law firms, medical practices, accounting firms, or joint ventures between existing businesses.
- **Pros**: 
  - Easy to establish with minimal paperwork
  - Shared financial commitment and workload
  - Pass-through taxation
  - Complementary skills and resources
  - Flexible management structure
- **Cons**: 
  - Unlimited personal liability in general partnerships
  - Joint and several liability (responsible for partner actions)
  - Shared profits regardless of contribution (unless specified otherwise)
  - Potential for conflicts between partners
  - Limited life (can end if a partner leaves)
  - Each general partner can bind the partnership

## Key Factors to Consider

1. **Liability Protection**: How much personal protection do you need based on your industry's risks?
2. **Taxation**: Which tax structure benefits your situation and projected income?
3. **Ownership Structure**: Solo founder or multiple owners? How will ownership change over time?
4. **Investment Plans**: Will you seek outside funding from angels, VCs, or other sources?
5. **Administrative Complexity**: How much paperwork and compliance can you handle or afford?
6. **Growth Plans**: What are your long-term goals for the business (lifestyle, acquisition, IPO)?
7. **Industry Norms**: What structures are common in your industry?
8. **State-Specific Considerations**: How do state laws and taxes affect your choice?

## Industry-Specific Considerations

Different industries often favor certain business structures:

- **Technology Startups**: Often C-Corps (especially if seeking VC funding)
- **Real Estate**: Commonly LLCs for liability protection and tax benefits
- **Professional Services**: Often LLCs or LLPs (law, accounting, consulting)
- **Retail/E-commerce**: Varies, but LLCs are common for smaller operations
- **Freelancers/Creators**: Often start as Sole Proprietors, then transition to LLCs

## State-Specific Considerations

Your state of formation matters significantly:

- **Delaware**: Business-friendly laws, specialized business court, privacy advantages
- **Nevada**: No state income tax, strong liability protection, privacy benefits
- **Wyoming**: Low fees, no state income tax, strong asset protection
- **Home State**: Often simplest and most cost-effective if operating locally

# Setting Up Your Business Foundation: The Essential Building Blocks

Before you can register your business entity, you need to prepare several key components. This module will walk you through each step to ensure you're ready to file.

## Choose Your Business Name

Your business name is a critical part of your brand identity and legal identity. It needs to be:
- **Memorable and relevant** to your business offerings
- **Available in your state's business registry** (each state maintains its own database)
- **Available as a domain name** (ideally .com, but alternatives work too)
- **Not infringing on existing trademarks** (federal or state level)
- **Compliant with state naming rules** (e.g., must include "LLC" or "Inc.")

### Tips for Choosing a Name:
- **Make it easy to spell and pronounce** to avoid confusion
- **Avoid names that limit your business growth** (e.g., "Seattle Plumbing" if you might expand)
- **Consider how it will look** on a logo, website, and business cards
- **Test it with potential customers** to ensure positive associations
- **Check social media availability** for consistent branding
- **Consider trademark potential** if your brand will be valuable

### Name Restrictions to Be Aware Of:

Most states prohibit business names that:
- Imply banking, insurance, or legal services without proper licensing
- Include words like "Federal," "National," "United States," or "Reserve"
- Are identical or deceptively similar to existing businesses
- Contain profanity or offensive language
- Imply a different entity type than what you're forming

## Select Your State of Formation

You can form your business in any state, not just where you live. Consider:

### Home State Formation:
- **Simplest option** if you'll operate primarily in one state
- **Avoid "foreign qualification" fees** (required when operating in states other than your formation state)
- **Lower ongoing compliance costs** (no multiple state filings)
- **Familiarity with local requirements** and resources
- **Proximity to state offices** if in-person filing is needed

### Delaware Formation:
- **Business-friendly laws and courts** (Court of Chancery specializes in business cases)
- **Privacy advantages** (member/manager names not required on public filings)
- **Preferred by investors** and familiar to lawyers nationwide
- **Flexible corporate laws** with strong precedent
- **But**: Additional costs if operating in another state (foreign qualification)
- **But**: Franchise tax requirements regardless of profitability

### Nevada Formation:
- **No state income tax, franchise tax, or inheritance tax**
- **Strong privacy protections** for owners
- **No information sharing agreement** with the IRS
- **But**: Still requires foreign qualification if operating elsewhere
- **But**: Annual fees can be higher than other states

### Other Considerations:
- **State filing fees** (range from $40 to $500+)
- **Annual report requirements and fees**
- **State taxes and franchise fees** (some states charge regardless of profitability)
- **Publication requirements** (some states require newspaper announcements)
- **Processing times** (can range from same-day to several weeks)
- **Registered agent requirements** (some states have stricter rules)

## Choose a Registered Agent

A registered agent is a person or company that accepts legal documents (like service of process, government correspondence, and compliance documents) on behalf of your business. They must:
- **Have a physical address** (not a P.O. box) in the state of formation
- **Be available during regular business hours** (9am-5pm, Monday-Friday)
- **Be willing to receive legal documents** and promptly forward them to you
- **Be at least 18 years old** (if an individual)
- **Have a reliable system** for document handling and notification

### Options:
- **Yourself** (if you have an address in the state and are always available)
- **Co-founder or employee** (must meet all requirements above)
- **Professional registered agent service** ($100-$300/year)
- **Your business attorney** (often included in formation packages)
- **Formation company** (often bundled with their formation services)

### Pros and Cons of Being Your Own Agent:

**Pros:**
- No additional cost
- Direct receipt of documents

**Cons:**
- Your address becomes public record
- Must be available during business hours
- Risk of missing important documents if you move or travel
- Potentially embarrassing to receive legal documents in front of clients

## Prepare Your Business Address

You'll need a physical address for your business for various filings and correspondence. Options include:
- **Your home address** (consider privacy implications)
- **Rented office space** (traditional commercial lease)
- **Virtual office service** ($50-$200/month, includes mail handling)
- **Co-working space** (often provides a business address service)
- **P.O. Box** (not acceptable for all purposes, but useful for mail)

### Address Requirements:
- Must be a physical street address (not just a P.O. Box)
- Must be in the state of formation (for registered agent)
- Should be reliable for receiving important mail
- Consider privacy implications (addresses become public record)

## Write Your Business Purpose

You'll need to describe what your business does for your formation documents. This can be:
- **Specific**: "Developing mobile applications for the healthcare industry"
- **General**: "Engaging in any lawful business activity"
- **Industry-focused**: "Providing consulting services in the field of digital marketing"
- **Product-oriented**: "Manufacturing and selling organic skincare products"

A general purpose gives you flexibility for future pivots, but some states require more specificity. Consider:

- **Current activities**: What you're doing now
- **Planned activities**: What you expect to do in the near future
- **Potential pivots**: How much flexibility you need
- **State requirements**: Some states require more specific language

### Sample Purpose Statements:

1. **General Purpose**: "To engage in any lawful act or activity for which [entity type] may be organized in this state."

2. **E-commerce**: "To sell products online and through other distribution channels, and to engage in any other lawful business activity."

3. **Service Business**: "To provide consulting services in the field of digital marketing, and any other lawful business purpose."

# Filing Your Business Entity: Making It Official

Now that you've prepared your business foundation, it's time to officially register your entity with the state. This module will guide you through the filing process based on your chosen entity type and state. This is the moment your business becomes a legal entity!

## Filing Options

You have two main options for filing your business entity:

### Option 1: DIY Filing
- **Lower cost** (just state filing fees)
- **More time-intensive** (typically 1-3 hours of work)
- **You handle all paperwork** and follow up
- **Requires attention to detail** and research
- **You maintain control** over the entire process
- **Typical cost**: $40-$500 (state filing fees only)

### Option 2: Use a Formation Service
- **Higher cost** (service fee + state filing fees)
- **Saves time and reduces errors**
- **They handle the paperwork** and follow up
- **May include additional services** (registered agent, EIN filing, etc.)
- **Provides peace of mind** for first-time founders
- **Typical cost**: $100-$500 + state filing fees

### Popular Formation Services:

1. **ZenBusiness**: Affordable packages starting around $49 + state fees
2. **Incfile**: Offers free LLC formation (just pay state fees)
3. **Northwest Registered Agent**: Premium service with privacy focus
4. **LegalZoom**: Well-known with extensive service offerings
5. **Stripe Atlas**: Comprehensive package for startups ($500)

## State-Specific Filing Requirements

Each state has different requirements, forms, and fees. Below is general guidance, but you'll need to follow your specific state's process.

### For LLC Formation:
1. **Prepare Articles of Organization**
   - Official document establishing your LLC
   - Contains basic information about your business
   - May be called "Certificate of Formation" in some states

2. **File with your state's business division** (usually Secretary of State)
   - Most states offer online filing
   - Some still require mail or in-person filing
   - Follow instructions carefully for your state

3. **Pay filing fee** (ranges from $40-$500 depending on state)
   - Fees are non-refundable even if rejected
   - Some states have additional publication fees

4. **Wait for approval** (typically 1-3 weeks, expedited options available)
   - Processing times vary significantly by state
   - Many states offer expedited processing for additional fees
   - You'll receive a certificate of formation/organization when approved

### For Corporation Formation:
1. **Prepare Articles of Incorporation**
   - Official document establishing your corporation
   - More detailed than LLC articles in most states
   - Must specify authorized shares and par value

2. **File with your state's business division**
   - Similar process to LLC filing
   - May require more information than LLC filings

3. **Pay filing fee** (typically higher than LLC fees)
   - Corporate fees often range from $100-$800
   - May include franchise tax prepayments in some states

4. **Wait for approval**
   - Similar timeframes to LLC processing

5. **Hold initial board meeting**
   - Adopt bylaws
   - Appoint officers
   - Authorize issuance of stock
   - Document in meeting minutes

6. **Issue stock certificates**
   - Create and distribute certificates to shareholders
   - Maintain stock ledger
   - Consider securities law compliance

### For Sole Proprietorship:
1. **File a DBA ("doing business as")** if using a name other than your legal name
   - Also called "fictitious name registration"
   - Usually filed at county level
   - Typically costs $25-$100

2. **Apply for necessary local business licenses**
   - Requirements vary by location and industry
   - May include city, county, and state licenses

3. **No state filing required for the entity itself**
   - The business has no separate legal existence
   - You are automatically a sole proprietor when you start doing business

## What You'll Need to File

- **Business name** (exactly as you want it registered)
- **Business address** (physical address in most cases)
- **Registered agent information** (name and address)
- **Names of members/managers** (LLC) or directors/officers (corporation)
- **Business purpose** statement
- **Duration of the entity** (usually "perpetual")
- **Payment method for filing fees** (credit card for online filing)
- **Contact information** for confirmation and questions
- **EIN** (for some filings, though usually obtained after formation)

## After Filing

Once your filing is approved, you'll receive:
- **Certificate of Formation/Organization** (LLC)
- **Certificate of Incorporation** (Corporation)
- **State filing number** or entity ID
- **Welcome packet** (in some states)
- **Information about ongoing requirements**

Keep these documents safe - you'll need them for the next steps.

## Next Steps Preview

After your entity is approved, you'll need to:
1. **Obtain an EIN** (Employer Identification Number)
2. **Open a business bank account**
3. **Create an operating agreement** (LLC) or bylaws (corporation)
4. **Set up accounting systems**
5. **Apply for necessary licenses and permits**
6. **Set up tax accounts** (sales tax, employment tax, etc.)
7. **Obtain business insurance**
8. **Comply with local regulations** (zoning, signage, etc.)

## Common Filing Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Incorrect entity name**: Forgetting required designators (LLC, Inc., etc.)
2. **Missing information**: Incomplete applications get rejected
3. **Wrong filing fee**: Incorrect payment amounts delay processing
4. **Choosing the wrong entity type**: Changing later can be costly
5. **Listing the wrong registered agent**: Must meet all requirements
6. **Filing in the wrong state**: Consider where you'll actually operate
7. **Ignoring publication requirements**: Some states require newspaper notices

# Setting Up Your Back Office: The Business Foundation

Congratulations on filing your business entity! Now it's time to set up the essential systems that will make your business operational and compliant. These foundational elements are critical for legal protection, tax compliance, and professional operations.

## Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN)

An EIN (also called a Federal Tax Identification Number) is like a social security number for your business. You'll need it to:
- **Open a business bank account**
- **File business taxes**
- **Hire employees or contractors**
- **Apply for business licenses**
- **Establish business credit**
- **Apply for business loans**

### How to Apply:
- **Apply online through the IRS website** (free)
- **Receive your EIN immediately** after applying online
- **No need for a third-party service** (though many offer this for a fee)
- **Available Monday-Friday, 7am-10pm Eastern Time**
- **International applicants** must call the IRS instead of using the online system

**Note:** Sole proprietors without employees can use their SSN instead of an EIN, but getting an EIN is still recommended for privacy and professionalism.

### What You'll Need for EIN Application:

- Legal name of the entity
- Entity type (LLC, Corporation, etc.)
- Responsible party's name and SSN (usually the owner or principal)
- Physical address and mailing address
- Reason for applying
- Principal business activity
- Date business started or acquired
- Number of employees expected in the next 12 months

## Open a Business Bank Account

Separating personal and business finances is crucial for:

## Create Governing Documents

### Options:
