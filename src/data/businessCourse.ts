# Choosing Your Business Structure

The legal structure you choose for your business will impact your taxes, personal liability, paperwork, ability to raise money, and more.

## Common Business Structures

### Sole Proprietorship
- **Definition**: A business owned and operated by one person with no legal distinction between the owner and the business.
- **Best for**: Freelancers, consultants, and low-risk businesses just starting out.
- **Pros**: Simple to form, complete control, minimal paperwork, pass-through taxation.
- **Cons**: Unlimited personal liability, difficult to raise capital, limited life.

### Limited Liability Company (LLC)
- **Definition**: A hybrid structure that provides the liability protection of a corporation with the tax benefits of a partnership.
- **Best for**: Small to medium businesses seeking liability protection without corporate complexity.
- **Pros**: Limited personal liability, pass-through taxation, management flexibility, fewer formalities.
- **Cons**: More expensive to form than sole proprietorships, self-employment taxes.

### C Corporation
- **Definition**: A legal entity separate from its owners, with its own rights and liabilities.
- **Best for**: Businesses planning to go public, raise significant capital, or scale significantly.
- **Pros**: Limited liability, ability to raise capital, perpetual existence, tax deductions.
- **Cons**: Double taxation, expensive to form, extensive record-keeping, more regulations.

### S Corporation
- **Definition**: A corporation that elects to pass corporate income, losses, deductions, and credits through to shareholders.
- **Best for**: Small to medium businesses that would benefit from corporate structure but want pass-through taxation.
- **Pros**: Limited liability, pass-through taxation, potential tax savings on self-employment taxes.
- **Cons**: Strict qualification requirements, limited to 100 shareholders, one class of stock.

### Partnership
- **Definition**: A business relationship between two or more people who conduct business together.
- **Best for**: Professional groups like law firms, medical practices, or joint ventures.
- **Pros**: Easy to establish, shared financial commitment, complementary skills.
- **Cons**: Unlimited personal liability (except in LLPs), shared profits, potential for conflicts.

## Key Factors to Consider

1. **Liability**: How much personal protection do you need?
2. **Taxation**: Which tax structure benefits your situation?
3. **Ownership**: Solo founder or multiple owners?
4. **Investment**: Will you seek outside funding?
5. **Complexity**: How much paperwork and compliance can you handle?
6. **Growth Plans**: What are your long-term goals for the business?

# Setting Up Your Business Foundation

Before you can register your business entity, you need to prepare several key components. This module will walk you through each step to ensure you're ready to file.

## Choose Your Business Name

Your business name is a critical part of your brand identity. It needs to be:
- Memorable and relevant to your business
- Available in your state's business registry
- Available as a domain name (ideally)
- Not infringing on existing trademarks

### Tips for Choosing a Name:
- Make it easy to spell and pronounce
- Avoid names that limit your business growth
- Consider how it will look on a logo, website, and business cards
- Test it with potential customers

## Select Your State of Formation

You can form your business in any state, not just where you live. Consider:

### Home State Formation:
- Simplest option if you'll operate primarily in one state
- Avoid "foreign qualification" fees
- Lower ongoing compliance costs

### Delaware Formation:
- Business-friendly laws and courts
- Privacy advantages
- Preferred by investors
- But: Additional costs if operating in another state

### Other Considerations:
- State filing fees (range from $40 to $500+)
- Annual report requirements
- State taxes and franchise fees

## Choose a Registered Agent

A registered agent is a person or company that accepts legal documents on behalf of your business. They must:
- Have a physical address in the state of formation
- Be available during business hours
- Be willing to receive legal documents

### Options:
- Yourself (if you have an address in the state)
- Co-founder or employee
- Professional registered agent service ($100-$300/year)
- Your business attorney

## Prepare Your Business Address

You'll need a physical address for your business. Options include:
- Your home address (consider privacy implications)
- Rented office space
- Virtual office service
- Co-working space

## Write Your Business Purpose

You'll need to describe what your business does. This can be:
- Specific: "Developing mobile applications for the healthcare industry"
- General: "Engaging in any lawful business activity"

A general purpose gives you flexibility, but some states require more specificity.

Complete the checklist below to ensure you're ready for the next step: filing your entity.

# Filing Your Business Entity

Now that you've prepared your business foundation, it's time to officially register your entity with the state. This module will guide you through the filing process based on your chosen entity type and state.

## Filing Options

You have two main options for filing your business entity:

### Option 1: DIY Filing
- Lower cost (just state filing fees)
- More time-intensive
- You handle all paperwork
- Requires attention to detail

### Option 2: Use a Formation Service
- Higher cost (service fee + state filing fees)
- Saves time and reduces errors
- They handle the paperwork
- May include additional services (registered agent, etc.)

## State-Specific Filing Requirements

Each state has different requirements, forms, and fees. Below is general guidance, but you'll need to follow your specific state's process.

### For LLC Formation:
1. Prepare Articles of Organization
2. File with your state's business division (usually Secretary of State)
3. Pay filing fee (ranges from $40-$500 depending on state)
4. Wait for approval (typically 1-3 weeks, expedited options available)

### For Corporation Formation:
1. Prepare Articles of Incorporation
2. File with your state's business division
3. Pay filing fee (typically higher than LLC fees)
4. Wait for approval
5. Hold initial board meeting
6. Issue stock certificates

### For Sole Proprietorship:
1. File a DBA ("doing business as") if using a name other than your legal name
2. Apply for necessary local business licenses
3. No state filing required for the entity itself

## What You'll Need to File

- Business name
- Business address
- Registered agent information
- Names of members/managers (LLC) or directors/officers (corporation)
- Business purpose
- Duration of the entity (usually "perpetual")
- Payment method for filing fees

## After Filing

Once your filing is approved, you'll receive:
- Certificate of Formation/Organization (LLC)
- Certificate of Incorporation (Corporation)
- State filing number

Keep these documents safe - you'll need them for the next steps.

## Next Steps Preview

After your entity is approved, you'll need to:
1. Obtain an EIN (Employer Identification Number)
2. Open a business bank account
3. Create an operating agreement (LLC) or bylaws (corporation)
4. Set up accounting systems

# Setting Up Your Back Office

Congratulations on filing your business entity! Now it's time to set up the essential systems that will make your business operational and compliant.

## Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN)

An EIN is like a social security number for your business. You'll need it to:
- Open a business bank account
- File business taxes
- Hire employees
- Apply for business licenses

### How to Apply:
- Apply online through the IRS website (free)
- Receive your EIN immediately after applying
- No need for a third-party service

**Note:** Sole proprietors without employees can use their SSN instead of an EIN, but getting an EIN is still recommended.

## Open a Business Bank Account

Separating personal and business finances is crucial for:
- Legal protection (maintaining your liability shield)
- Clean accounting
- Tax preparation
- Professional image

### What You'll Need:
- EIN
- Formation documents (Articles of Organization/Incorporation)
- Business license (if required in your jurisdiction)
- Photo ID

### Recommended Account Features:
- Low or no monthly fees
- Free transactions
- Online banking
- Business debit card
- Integration with accounting software

## Create Governing Documents

### For LLCs: Operating Agreement
- Defines ownership percentages
- Outlines management structure
- Sets rules for decision-making
- Establishes procedures for member changes
- Not required in all states, but highly recommended

### For Corporations: Bylaws
- Establishes board of directors
- Defines officer roles
- Sets shareholder rights
